# w18-cs241-project3
Project to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path in graphs.

Main method is located in Project3.java

This program demonstrates the use of Dijkstra's algorithm in order to find the shortest paths in a graph, as well as a few other features
such as inserting and deleting edges.

The final state of this project, as is archived here, uses the graph's nodes to represent cities, and edges to represent roads.
Thus, my task for this project was to simulate a GPS.

The documentation should cover the criteria for how the data files are to be formatted, but I've included the data files provided
by the course instructor, which could be found in the bin folder.


Here is an example of the program:
